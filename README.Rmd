# wcrs
The goal of _wcrs_ is to provide a series of tools to implement a
Weighted Competing Risks analysis in a unified framework. 

The package is designed to estimate weighted cumulative incidence 
functions in a competing risks setting, plot them and return useful
statistical summaries, such as 1-year cumulative incidence of cardiac 
death in subjects who had heart failure. Furthermore, functions to fit
weighted cause-specific hazard models are also available.

The functions are targeted for Propensity Score Inverse Probability
Weighting (PS-IPW) analyses, where weights derived from estimated
PS are used to approximate a randomized study.

## Installation
You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with the following procedure:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("UBESP-DCTV/wcrs")
```
